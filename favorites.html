    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <div>
        My main hobby is journaling. Everyday, I enjoy writing down my thoughts and experiences. I find it to be ag reat way to
        help me think and process my emotions. Furthermore, I also like the experience of using nice, ergonomic mechanical pencils.
        Journaling has given me a way to use such pencils more frequently in a world that's becoming more electronic. Overall, I'm 
        really excited to write my daily journal so that when I grow old, I have something to look back on.

    <div>
        In the video below, you see that in my current journal, I still have a lot to write. I always try to condense my thoughts into one 
        page. I do this for space and money purposes, as if I were to go over one page, I would go through journals pretty frequently. As moleskine 
        journals can go for $40 in Barnes & Nobles, I don't want to spend a lot of of money too quickly.
