                    <td>Great</td>
                    <td>Good Bubble Tea that isn't too expensive. My favorite size is the Stubby Cup since there is so much
                        tea in it. Granted, that size is $10. The surrounding area is also pretty quiet. The inside is small, but is 
                        clean and has a nice aesthetic.</td>

                    <td>It has a great selection of books. The building nice and air conditioned as well. Furthermore, the staff are all nice 
                        and really helpful. There's a starbucks on the third floor as well, so that's a plus.</td>

                    <td>Tompkins Square Park is one of the worst parks in NYC. The park itself and its surroundings smell bad. My nose picks up hints 
                        of urine and feces everytime I pass by. The park is also not safe at night, as drug users frequent the area.</td>
